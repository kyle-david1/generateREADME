## README Generator

## Description
Using the node inquire package, a series of predefined questions are written to make up the skeleton of the generated README. Using the command line interface, the user is prompted with a series of questions that are uniquely answered, and, using the writefile and fs properties, a user is able to generate a README for their specific project.
